      College of Engineering (CoE) was one of the three colleges that opened
      with the establishment of the University of Sulaimani in 1968. The college
      started with the department of Civil Engineering, which admitted 44
      students for the first academic year of (1968-1969). In (1973-1974), the
      department of Electrical Engineering was added to the college with the
      acceptance of 30 students. The first graduated BSc class was in
      (1971-1972). The number of students was steadily increasing throughout the
      years that followed. By (1981), 1451 students had graduated in 10 BSc
      classes from the School. At that year the University of Sulaimani was
      closed and moved to the city of Erbil under a new name, the University of
      Salahaddin. The University of Sulaimani was re-established in (1992) in
      Sulaymaniyah city, and the College of Engineering was re-opened in
      (September 1995) with the department of Irrigation (renamed: Water
      Resources) Engineering. Then the Building Construction department began
      accepting students for the academic year (1996-1997) followed by the
      department of Architecture Engineering (1999-2000). After that, the
      department of Electrical Engineering was founded for the academic year
      (2004–2005). Between 1995 and 2021, 4748 engineers graduated with a
      bachelor’s degree from the College of Engineering with a percentage ratio
      of 55% male to 45% female.
