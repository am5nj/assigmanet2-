      The College of Science at the University of Sulaimani endeavors to be the
      premier source for science education in the Sulaimani local community and
      the Kurdistan region in general. The College attempts to be a regional
      center for science education and innovation which develops appropriate
      educational programs of high quality for the undergraduate program and
      creative and advanced postgraduate programs to satisfy the growing
      emerging needs of the region for qualified, skilled, and professional
      graduates. The College has developed strong, well studied and continuously
      updated curricula that guide students through the theoretical and
      practical aspects of their chosen disciplines and provide them with
      sufficient breadth to understand and successfully meet the challenges of
      the rapidly changing society. The College of Science is also committed to
      both basic and applied research with a special emphasis on areas of vital
      importance to Kurdistan. These researches are conducted within the college
      or as joint projects with other scholars from other institutions and are
      expected to have international standards and impacts. The College also
      regards research activity by both staff and students as being an integral
      part of the educational process and aims to provide an open and supportive
      research environment. In this regard, the College encourages student
      participation in research by conducting graduation research projects in
      their final year as an important requirement of the B.Sc. course. The
      College also plays an important role in promoting and supporting the
      general public awareness and understanding of basic sciences, by
      maintaining mutual collaboration programs with local organizations and by
      providing support and specialized courses, lectures, and consultancy to
      different sectors of the local community.
